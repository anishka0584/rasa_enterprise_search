  pattern_chitchat:
    description: >
      Handles ONLY purely social messages with absolutely no connection to hotels, travel, rooms,
      pets, policies, bookings, locations, amenities, dates, or anything hotel-related whatsoever.
      Examples of genuine chitchat ONLY: 'how are you', 'tell me a joke', 'what is the meaning of life',
      'who made you', 'what can you do', 'are you a robot'.
      Do NOT trigger this for ANY hotel or travel related question, no matter how it is phrased.
      Do NOT trigger this when the user is answering a booking question with a number, date, or location.
      If in doubt between chitchat and search, always choose search.

  pattern_search:
    description: >
      Handles ANY question or query that relates to hotels, travel, rooms, pets, policies,
      amenities, bookings, locations, or any hotel-related topic — even if a booking flow
      is currently active. Always prefer this over pattern_chitchat when the question has
      anything to do with hotels or travel.
      Trigger this for questions like:
      'can I bring my dog', 'do you allow pets', 'is there a pet fee',
      'is breakfast included', 'what time is check-in', 'what time is check-out',
      'can I check in early', 'is there parking', 'do you have Wi-Fi',
      'what room types are available', 'can I cancel my booking',
      'is there air conditioning', 'are children allowed', 'do you have accessible rooms',
      'what is the cancellation policy', 'how do I pay', 'is there a booking fee',
      'what locations do you cover', 'which cities can I book in', 'where can I book',
      'can I get a discount', 'do you have cribs', 'what is the maximum stay',
      'how many rooms can I book', 'how many guests can I bring',
      'do you have family rooms', 'is there a pool', 'what hotels do you offer',
      'how do I modify my booking', 'is my booking confirmed', 'how do I contact support'.
      When uncertain whether a question is chitchat or search, ALWAYS choose pattern_search.
    name: pattern search
    steps:
      - action: action_trigger_search

  pattern_cancel_flow:
    description: >
      Triggered ONLY when the user clearly wants to stop and cancel the current booking process.
      Phrases that trigger this: 'cancel', 'stop', 'I do not want to book anymore',
      'forget it', 'never mind', 'I changed my mind', 'exit', 'quit', 'I want to cancel'.
      Do NOT trigger this for general questions or FAQs.
